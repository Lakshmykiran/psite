<h1 align="center">The Crosstrek</h1>

<pre font style="font-size:100%" font face="timesnewroman">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCompletely reengineered, still game-changing.The name has stayed the same, everything else has changed the 2018 Subaru Crosstrek is all-new 
    from the ground up, inside and out and from top to bottom. The changes include a new platform with a new suspension system. A new SUBARU BOXER 
    engine and new transmissions. A redesigned exterior.And a more spacious, more comfortable and more connected passenger cabin. With the value-
    packed Crosstrek, you have all the benefits of a true crossover (generous ground clearance, ample cargo space, excellent versatility) combined
    with the advantages of a sporty hatch (crisp response, superior handling, stellar fuel efficiency). And with standard Subaru symmetrical full-
    time AWD, you have the unique ability to escape from it all at a momentâ€™s notice. The new Crosstrek is an even more perfect choice for urban
    types who crave fun, inside or outside the city limits.</pre>
